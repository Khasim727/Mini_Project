WFH for life Good bunch of people to collaborate with in tech side good company for just to start your career and stay for 1 year
holidays are less Salary hike is comparatively less Limited knowledge grasping with respect to webscraping
"1. CEO is not there to grow company, he want to run it as grocery shop. He takes people on very low salary promising they will be working on python, big data, elasticsearch etc but you will be only working on ruby and that too in crawling only. you will be stuck in repeated loop."

"There could be additional automation (its already automated at most parts but still) to work that is done manually as of now, which could reduce the project support time taken and focus on other things,"
"1. Best teammates to work with . 2. Freedom to explore and implement new things . 3. Work appreciation on regular basics, its something i like most. 4. I am working here from last 1 year and never saw any internal politics that i use to hear from my many friends those who are working in other IT companies."

There is nothing as I know about Promptcloud's cons so far.
Nothing to point out. Company is doing the best.
seriously none. I was here for 7 months and this by far has been the worst company ever I have worked in my 11 years of career
Incredible journey so far - the pedigree and caliber of talent I'm surrounded by is top notch. Opportunity to work with a diverse group of people located all over the Globe.
*Management is run by a couple and literally every aspect in this company is run by the couple.
Great Environment for freshers to learn and explore
The company is mainly focused on the web scrapping industry. Those who really want to grow in the field of web scrapping can join this company
No cons about this company and the company's office location are so convenient

.Perfect work and personal life balance due to complete wfh 2.Supportive seniors 3.Good company to learn and grow
"No cons, Everything is good and well structured."
The working culture of this company is very good.
"I am in a technical role for more than 1 yr, I like the challenges that come with my role. Work is generally mixed, parts of it is easy (like I believe most of the places), other stuff are challengeing."
there are few cons but they can be ignored as these are minor issues.
"Lot of learning opportunities are their in Prompt cloud , teams are good supports new joiners and friendly .."
"As the scale is growing, it should be more thought in terms of processes otherwise it leads to confusion."
"No such cons , as per my tenure , it was good ."
Complete Remote Work since pandemic
Hiring should be more prioritized given the growth.
Management is poor very poor
it is a good starup company
This is a fit place if you are looking to make impact. There is lot of freedom and opportunity for those who put in effort and are passionate.
doesnt have office space as its shifted to remote working
Only good for interns or entry level
More office ameneties would be good
Poor salary Lack of good hiring Poor Management skill Lack of Benefits/perks as compare to industries standard
"ood place to work at, and a good bunch of people to work with."
"Policy on leaves is something I do not like much, still ok considering it is a small organization."
I joined PromptCloud early in my career and I'm really thankful that I did so. Amount of things you can learn here is massive. At times it puts pressure too but later you realize the growth. When I joined initially in a month I learnt more than what I had learn in past 1 year.
More office ameneties would be good
We should allow work from home option selectively at least
"Complete freedom and ownership of work. Working on new things irrespective of your function - there's immense value in learning, especially in the first 5 years of one's career."
"Unlimited scope to explore new technologies. Besides, it provides the platform to work with some really self-motivated engineers striving every moment to come up with something new. 2) work hard, earn high policy"
The 'startup' feel is not retiring.
There are little to none The office is located in indranagar
A bit more perks and benefits would have been good.
"The office is located on top of a chicken shop, always stinks up entire place ,it gets worse when it rains."
"One of the friendliest companies to work that comes with great work culture. You get a lot of freedom to work on things you love professionally, make mistakes, learn and unlearn as well. Based on the performance you are also given complete ownership for various tasks along with opportunity to help your team members. There were always things to do in the company for various fun activities (Merry Mondays, Fun Fridays), team outings, and plethora of celebrations - from Independence Day and Diwali to Eid and Christmas."
Exciting products and talented people along with a great work culture. The best part is that you have a ton of autonomy at this company. 
Can not think of any.
myriad of things to learn starting from growing a business o tech - your voice is heard and all feedback incorporated A83
Nothing that i can think of at the moment.
- no org structure yet
"Flexible timing, more work pressure, Not much politics among employee"
I joined here early in my career and grew over the time.
"To future joinee - Work there is nowhere related to Big Data/Machine Learning. Work is highly repetitive, no learning after 6 months. "
I learnt more here in 3 months here than I had done in 1/1.5 years before PromptCloud I like the freedom given here to design and implement the solutions.
"Office at times feels too quiet. Standard for output is high, which at times might lead to pressure if you are not very good technically."
Work from home was not there but because of Covid it has changed. Need to see though what new policy will be like.
"i cant guess any, except you may get good colleague. you will only get to know about crawling."
"you have to work, work and work"
Lots of things to learn . Good work environment and compensation. Also gives end to end exposure and and opportunity to pickup things independently. Training program is very well structured too.
Great environment. Lot of freedom to try out things and experiment. Focus on result.
"This being a startup, things become a bit hectic at times."
With the size growing now we feel there are more processes
got to learn some new technologies
1. colleagues are friendly and used to give good advises.
they need to understand the value of people
1. unfunded startup with no significant traction
A place where you can learn and stay motivated.
You will get a platform to learn lots of things
tough to work-life balance
Less benefits compare to other startups.
No Pros for full-time employees
Poor management
