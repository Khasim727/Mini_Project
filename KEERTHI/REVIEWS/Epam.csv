1. Level up process is very tough 2. difficult to crack internal assessment process
Management is helping. Flexibility in timings
No cons are there as of now
Difficult to get on to project. Billability is must to survive.
1). Good legacy based projects. 2). Nice campus in Hyderabad. 3). MNC with more then 60K employees
1). Unified assessment is not worth it as it is for name sake just to impress candidates before joining.
Skill development program is much better than other orgs
No cons are there as of now
"Unstable, old tech stack projects, extremely difficult client interviews"
One big advantage of working at Epam is that we have a very clear roadmap of the job and the improvements that we make in the process.
Does not stress enough on a couple of things like CSR activities. More work in this respect specially in Bangalore and Hyderabad needs to be done.
Challenging environment Good Salary Learning scope is good
No job security. No Bench Lack of projects

Good Environment. Good incentives. Location Infrastructure Sports

Bench time is not good.

All fixed salary and no bonus
"1. Being in Service company, being on bench is risky 2. Not every project is a good fit for your profile"
Good clients here and very nice culture
Micro managment and very less leaves
Till I haven't see any cons here

Epam is good company and have good people Good and timely pay as per industry The best part is less politics and less favoritism.
no much understanding on cons
Only cons is it's a service based company so you have to interview after every project completed.
Good work life balance Chance to live with our passion through epam clubs Good learning culture Good exposure to pre sales and RFPs at lead level itself
good company for work place
As part of my 5 years experience I did not find any cons. My only observation is HRBP can be improved at EPAM India.
they provide wroke from home
Such a diverse and unique and versatile community and organisation. As per my understanding EPAM is the best work culture we can have on earth.
nothing are there all good
Would get encouraged to learn new technology and do POC on those
New technology to learn Lot of resources and support to learn anything
They dont check on work while Appriasal Micromanagemnet is there
"Learning opportunities, lot of trainings, people friendly, good pay"
Less pay and no perks for employees except yearly gift
"Less projects for now, huge Bence count"
No pros at all.. may be decent salary
othing NA no comment can be made. It is the best ??????????????
Worst culture only firing employees
