We are so excited to work in this company and training is good
"No pros when we work with Company like Capgemini. No Future, No growth"
There is no disadvantages we are so happy
Good work Environment and supportive team
We can write a book of Cons while working with Capgemini. 
None as of now .
"Capgemini is worst company to work, Leadership people don't have brains. Don't know how to manage your resource, treating each one of them like sheep and slaves. "
Good Company Brand Value Good place for fresher to learn at initial stage.
Please don't Join in Capgemini. Your life will be big Question.
Steady income: One of the most significant advantages of working for a company is the ability to receive a steady and predictable income. T
For the sake of name only HR is present. No such roles they play. Increament only 3% per year If you have joined organisation with high package your increament may not happen or you will get 0% hike increament letter. You can feel the politics within team.
"Limited control: Working for a company often means following the company's policies and procedures, which can limit an employee's ability to make decisions independently."
"1) Great company culture: A company that prioritizes a positive work environment, collaboration, and work-life balance can be a major draw for employees. "
"he only Pro is that if you are ambitionless, you can stay here and do nothing at a mediocre salary"
None as of now .
"- The company is full of politics, since everyone gets bad hikes, people indulge in politics to get that extra "
Good work life balance here Nothing much to say
None as of now .
Comp is not as per arket stanards Nothing to learn
None as of now .
Food is not free of cost like some other companies offer (at least breakfast). No increment offered if you are yet to complete 1 year in company.
1>Pros is that capgemini do give well training on basic technical things via the "CIS academy" which is really good for a begineer to start with.
1. Decent salary if you're from a Tier 1-2 college and a promotion after approx 1.5 years
1>Me alongwith 2/3 friends who did very well in CIS academy trainings and even in product traning as we ranked in top 3 but our deployment happened totally on absurd basis(i.e. 
2. Poor management. New manager had no clue about anything and junior members had to do his work.
office is huge and clean
"Good for developed new skills, hood projects for development. "
Very bad if you join finance vertical especially banking and capital market and specifically idms business. they are not having any business and struggling.
Excellent and flexible work environment.
Employee efforts would not be considered. Focused on business side only. 
We can seen the location partiality in some managers.

"If you are into SAP tech, you have great opportunities to learn. And if you are performing well you have a chance to get an onsite opportunity as well."
We can seen the location partiality in some managers.?
"Nice company, helpfull people, if you want you can get work life balance"
Management (EM) is quite not comfortable. but it depends on the person.
"Big company so hard to navigate, less compensation compared to big4 even though top deliver"
> Good work environment. > Got enough flexibility in work provided and freedom to do it my way. > Working conditions are good. 
Good Salary Good Work life balance Hybrid work model
> There is so much politics on floor in Bengaluru premises which hampers a really good employer to work. 
good work life balance Adapting to new tech skills but still not upto the mark People are good they will give you designation based on experience and wont degrade the level like other companies.
Not good salary hike Locations are far away from city
-- All indian management in leadership -
"Work culture is good Transport facility, WFH"
There won’t be any rewards and recognition for the hard work we gave
Skill development Less compensation as compare to industry Promotion is based on manager not performance
Good work life balance i am currentl work with a great team.
Job safety and no comandedns and as a fresher its good company
Depends on you project and manager.
They don't encourage our intrests
Too much with work life balance gets impossible to provide time for family
"Below standard salary..highly demotivating No new opportunities , just have to work as per project requirement."
"Recognition, a Positive environment at work, cooperative and collaborative colleagues, great work-life balance, and opportunities to learn and grow."
"If you get a good project with nice colleagues and great manager, it is cool Or else wil have to struggle"
"Employees are not well compensated, unobliging HR, unequal representation of women and men in leadership positions."
Don't follow the root policies
Working only during working hours and not requiring overtime. They value the developer's personal life outside of work. 
All good and nice work culture
The only con is individual's compensation is not increasing at the desired rate.
"Freedom of work, Diversity and Flexibility"
Nothing to be improved as of now
"Yearly increment, No Bonus and additional benefit"
"1. Learning scope - Have unlimited access to Pluralsight, Udemy, Coursera. If someone is willing to learn (& get time ofcourse) this is great place."
"Architecture , Work from home and hybrid policy"
1. Poor infact Very Poor Salary hike 
"only good thing is that you have work life balance, but a lot depends on the project you are tagged in"
Did not like work culture
annual hike is in form of peanuts and even promotional hike is not at all compared to market
Good working culture for freshers
"Capgemini SE is a multinational information technology services and consulting company, headquartered in Paris"
They have not much opportunities for freshers project role.
