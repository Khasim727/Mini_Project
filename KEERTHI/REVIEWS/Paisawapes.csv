Reviews
Good work culture and can learn a lot
Nothing as such just started working
good relations in the company. Nice working conditions.
Too much work for an intern / fresher
"Founder is friendly and good. Flexible timings, good atmosphere and colleagues"
There is no cons as of now
Learnt a lot about content management systems
Not anything I can think of
"A lot of ownership at work. You own the peice of work that you do, nobody will direct you to do the work but in case if you need advice the founders will teach you things step by step."
A lot of work. Great place for a workaholic. Pay is okay.
