Great opportunity to learn new technologies . Place to improve your skills and knowledge . Very good culture
Not giving extra perks to the employees
We can get good technical work.
You will not equally treated as their local employees. There is process of firing. They can fire any one at anytime without any reason.
Acquiring companies as if going for a lavish shopping when you receive more than expected funds as bonus.
Offers high salary because of recent funding.
"Good environment for learners, Team is always open for new suggestions. A great platform which takes you to the next level."
Should implement more engagement activities.

there are no big cons here
New learning Automation Dev-ops Teamwork Shotout nominations

Could not find any Pros.
1. Too much politics 2. Salaries are not as per industry standards. 3. Too much micro-management. 4. No work-life balance.
Salary perks - you will get hike
Poor work life balance Politics You should be ready for humiliation You should forget your personal life High attrition ratio in HR team Don’t expect growth Everything is hiring and you will become puppet of seniors 15-16 hours working Though they have startup culture but they will judge you by your appearance. Think twice before joining
"Pay, Learning and work culture, Permanent WFH"
work is a bit fast paced and sometimes work life balance takes a hit
"- Leader in dynamic CPaas space, lot to learn about - Decent Pay - Aligned with the market need of PLG products, hence high growth potential"
- Growth depends on your relationship with few selected folks and not your talent and hard work
Work culture Good exposure to new projects
"work from home, there might be communication gap"
Decent salary hike (Cause they think money can buy everything)
"Learning, Good work to do, Skillful"
"Management is too poor, Pressure"
Good company for Fresher if you have any referral
Good company for Fresher if you have any referral otherwise they will not pampered you.To much of internal politics presents in many team. Bad behaviour of seniors and never clearify the 100% requirement what client want and what should do.
Got to know and hands on with many technologies in short period of time.
Lot of pressure during work. No work life balance
Best Company as far as I have worked with...
Management is not employee centric though company is...
Good friendly staff gold balance

This is the good place to learn new technology
Working style is different It should be in proper documentation

"No culture, no engagement thats it"
Company Culture Work Life Balance Salary Package
No Awards/recognition No proper medical insurance
"Decent salary on joining, timely payout"
"1. Very biased & old school mentality, few people set rules and enjoy credit for work. 2. I really liked the domain of work but this company has a pretty bad culture, have seen people openly shouting and unnecessarily blaming. 3. No processes at all to listen to employees or invest time in improving. They have a hire & fire policy. Avoid this company if you can."
Good Salary Flexible working hours
As of now not observed any cons
Good mentors Various tech stacks Hardworking environment
"Bad work life Can call whenever they please, treat like labourers"
"Great perks and salary offered. However, zero job security."
Zero work life balance and no employee satisfaction. Initially they will give you good perks and salary but there is no job security at all.

GS provides enormous learning and growth opportunities New ideas are appreciated and you get to do meaningful work. Opportunity to work with the best minds in the industry
Culture is little aggressive and dynamic as the co is growing this is causing some churn and attrition at the moment but the management is transparent about the goals and future of the org.
