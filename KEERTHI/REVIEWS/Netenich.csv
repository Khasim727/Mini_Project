Good work culture. Nice environment
Freedom to speak ideas Getting support to execute the ideas Collaborative team
"Nothing, no problems or issues"
Evolved as a great work place to collaborate and achieve much more that what we bargained for.
"As the company rakes in more Business and makes money, there are various ways that the employees can be made a part of the profits."
"- Just proud to be apart of MNC at bhimavaram, which has amazing office infrastructure - Higher management is very approachable - Friendly co-workers - Company and my reporting manager have been very supportive"
There are no cons here.
Working Experience is different from location to location
I worked in Netenrich for 3 yrs and was part of UC team and had a very positive experience. The management is very understanding
No Cons in the company
-- Collaborate with diff team and learn multiple technologies. -- Friendly employees -- Easy access to higher management
Packages is bit less with compared to other companies.
You can learn new things there is a good scope
"learning scope is there, they give better hikes compared to MNCs"
Senior management should observe who is working while hearted and who is not working
Good worklife balance in the company
"shift timings, lot of stress, poor management"
Lack of the Management foresight
We are given options to lead the company in a way that is good for the company and our growth.
"No cons as of now, everything is good."
Good work to have in company
"-It is made clear that you are an asset, and your growth is beneficial to both parties. -Friendly Co-workers."
"No concerns, good couture working"
-Multiple Accounts to handle. -Can implement better onboarding experience with clear communication of policies
Company understands work life balance and respect that. You get to work with top thought leaders Proud to work here as we are headed as a profitable and values driven organisation.
"The policies and procedures are to be briefed during the sessions and make sure they are followed, and queries must be handled in stipulated time."
"Work life is good, management is good and friendly environment in office."
The company is good in terms of perspective
All good so far ?????
Work life balance will be good
"I worked in the UCCE team, but a manager was a horrible person with micro-management and treated team members without respect"
they don't give good pay
"Good package, Free food, Transport facilities."
* People make Organization & they are Good People * Employee Friendly * Good Compensation
I don't find any as such
"1. Nice working culture. 2. Team is very good to work in an efficient manner. 3. A good learning time will provide you with the freshers as well. 4. You will get interested to learn new things in working style. 5. You can have a very good, comfortable working life with lots of knowledge & exploration."
* Usual Senior Cross functional Management issues (Not Major)
1. It was not a hybrid work model & work from the office.
It is perfect for people who love open culture & want to work in cutting edge technology.
You get good opportunities to grow in a positive environment.
Sometime over burdened by the processes.
"Very nice company to work with, work culture is super, I am happy to be a part of Netenrich. My team and higher management is always supportive every day is a new learning here ."
Nothing as such for now
No cons as of now.
"Good Knowledge , Satified with the Management"
Good Work environment Free Lunch Great colleagues
No words about to netenrich.
Great client base good exposure to things positive environment.
Good Work Culture Exposure to learning new skills and much more problems to solve
more learning platform should be provided so that employee can upskill.
Netenrich is a fast growing company and a wonderful place to work. The CEO and the leadership always welcome creativity and lead by example.
Employee engagement activities should be organized more frequently than usual. More effective training sessions should be planned.
Good for specific community of people. No pros will be there for anyone outside of one community.
"you will not find the company's recreational activities, team outings etc..."
There is no IT culture. Everywhere managements relatives and their community people will be onboarded starting from HR team.
Great place to work and good learning to help build your career
It is really good to work in such an environment
Career growth need to plan accordingly and management should know about your commitment and hardwork.
"If you don't want to grow professionally and want to work on the same roles and responsibilities then you choose NE, you will not be removed until you resign.."
"Lack of workers, because of that there are a lot of night shifts"
Favoritism works a lot. Cannot expect for a support to move to a technology tou like to work
Everything is great. So I don't see any cons.
Supporting team members Opportunity to learn new technologies Work life balance is good
Learning scope for everyone Good salary package Good environment Provides free food
Pay cut during the covid times. Management is only concerned about platform development and not bothered about demanding technologies such as Cloud services.
Everything Learning. Growth People Culture
Internal politics Hires refer candidates
Nothing to report now..all going good
Some projects are good it was more on development
Amazing culture - People are always willing to help The US leadership teams are full of energy.
I worked in a project where requirements come and go on fly. Totally we will be into support. Lack of learning.
Pay raises aren't something to be proud of Opportunities to travel to the US are very less and restricted to few roles Too many meetings / calls
"Good and smart people. Your position is supported company wide. Management is not distant and very responsive and great benefits such as health insurance, food, Work life balance, flexible leave policy"
Good company for working here
I do not see any
Infrastructure is good for the company
Nothing as such in office... Bangalore have good office.
Atmosphere is not good at office
- Good work life balance - People are helpful and there are a lot of experienced people who are easy to approach - Open to new innovation and ideas from anyone - Good place to start with a fresher with a decent package to start with
"Work life balance is good, people are welcoming."
- Salary hikes could be better. 
Good company to work with. Lot of opportunity to learn new things. And a company you look for retirement
"Pay can be better, sometimes the projects can be a little disorganised"
New office is far away from main city in a isolated place who no transport facility
Good place to learn and work
"Good comp, good hours, ok"
Nothing currently good company and management
good management. on time salary. good office.
"None really, okay company to work"
nothing. as of now. all good. not much.
Nice opportunity and growing Ala very fast
"Bigger team , Cab facility not available."
But less salary and no flexibility of time
- Team synch up - Supportive team -Better Pay
Best team to work with
Did not observed any yet
No cons I can think
Can live in home town
every thing management taking after covid
