"Safe, best environment and nice."
They hire a lot of freshers
No cons reg. job position
1. Opportunity to lean. - I've been worked here for 3 years (started my career here) and I got to learn a lot.
They are stuck python. Should move to new technologies
Good work life balance sometime.
"Unprofessional, less paying, negative environment"
"1. No senior to learn from, so they expects that from freshers."
"Decent place to work , less pressurizing ."
Friendly environment Coding standards and trending tech is followed
"Extensive probationary period without variable pay , moreover they may cut your variable pay which is according to the offer letter illegal to a considerable extent."
1:- you will get chance to work with multiple technologies
9 hours rule should be strictly followed Pay is less You get outsourced to somewhere else
1:- they ask u to learn technology and they expect you need to perform as architecture level in days 
"1. Opportunity to work on multiple technologies 2. Perks over Salary 3. Friendly team 4. Team building activities like outings, sports, pot lucks, etc 5. Learning sessions almost every week 6. RNR sessions recognising the employee performances 7. Work hours not beyond 7 PM (may stretch sometimes during client deliveries) 8. Care for employees"
1. Chance to work with New Technologis. 2. Lots of learning oppurtunities. 3. Less Workloads.
"Minor issues, can be ignored considering the above."
Scope for learning new technologies Good Client Base Healthy environment & friendly staff
Nothing i have for now.
It’s hard to think of any!
1. Working culture 2. Good learning curve
"Projects and work is assigned based on talent. If you want to be a professional in Software field, this is the company. There are good mentors and we get ample opportunities to learn and explore new technologies with them. Here growth is very fast with valuable experience."
--> Management will give opportunities to the employees to learn new things. --> Values the feedback given by the employees. --> HR Team will listen to the concerns & tries to solve it ASAP.
None that I can think of right now
-> No Cons as of now :-)
I Don't see any cons.
Are there any ? Let Bala(CEO) answer this because I couldn't find any for the time I was there.
Challenging work environment Non political environment (at least so far in my experience) Leadership makes you feel really important and part of something really big Open door culture
Projects assigned are based on talent and not degree. 
Less long-term visibility outside of project
One can excel at what they as mentors are very knowledgable and patient.
I have not see any downsides in headrun
- Lot of technologies to learn - Good career opportunities. - Supportive team - Fast paced - Startup culture - Managers pitch in whenever needed. - Good HR team
"Whatever you join as, you'll become a full stack developer juggling multiple technologies."
- Will be asked to work on multiple projects at once. - Starts with very low pay. - Policies are not employee friendly.
"Excellent learning opportunity. Salary is directly proportional to Talent/Hard work/contribution to the company. Awesome management. Everyone, including management is aware of who is doing what. So you will always be given credit for what you do. Positive relationships between employees and employer. More helping hands. Overall good company to work for anyone."
None I can thinnk of
No cons as of now.
I joined as fresher here. Training days are difficult but after that good scope to learn and growth is also nice. Chance to learn new technologies before others adapt. Giving awards in RnR events is very encouraging to employees
1. Managers are really helpful and polite despite being intellectual giants that they are. 2. Employees are given to work on the best problems which include Algorithmic challenges. 3. Annual appraisals are fantastic
No team building activities happen. Different teams work independently and don't interact much though its not a very big company
Sudden Requests to relocate will be troublesome
No Pros to say about this company.
-> Very Hectic culture. -> fewer salaries.
Awesome work-life balance. Very cool. Not much pressure to meet unreasonable / hard deadlines. Great benefits and rewards. 
Work becomes monotonous after a year in same project
Lot of Interesting problems to solve. Good performers get rewarded. Nice learning curve and exposure to new technologies.
One can get experience in technical as well as client dealing aspects. Good work environment
No health/medical insurance plan Stress busting options are missing
you ll get a lot to learn
Work life imbalance. Be prepared to work in your off hours as well
startup so cant rely on it
once can learn many things in very less time
"Learning Scope is very good, Good management and happy team"
you will be under pressure
"Since it is a start up, people are given more responsibilities."
"So much to learn, Good work. Best Company to work for freshers"
Some times work pressure is high.
"- new Things , Every Day .. & flexible timings"
it is a good company to start your career.
"if you don't love what you do , every thing will be cons"
Can learn new things if you are kept in a good project otherwise end up with crawling
for now no cons to say
no proper management immediate deadlines
Can Learn a lot.. Growth is more if you work hard
good colleagues and team work is valued
Too much pressure at work.
they are open and frank.
"management is average , hr could be better"
there is no freedom of work.
Chances to learn more technologies
Cannot think of any at the moment
"everything is good , nothing is there"
Politics
No management skills Toxic environment
Company culture is very bad
