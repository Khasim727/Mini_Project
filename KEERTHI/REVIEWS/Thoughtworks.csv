"friendly atmosphere , unlimited sick leaves, challenging work"
"office politics, sometimes pressure due to deadlines"
Open culture lets you learn and explore different aspects. Company culture lets you define the path you want to take within the organisation.
Quite different from a product based company.
"Good culture, people are knowledgable, Good to learn from others in the team. There is a lot of trust amongst employers and employees."
"Good culture, people are knowledgable, Good to learn from others in the team. There is a lot of trust amongst employers and employees."
No free time and no extra working hours. Just need to get it done what is required. Values employees interests.
Nothing much. Salary is not that competitve
None i could find in one and half year.
They laid off the recruiter team stating that they were not performing however there was hiring freeze for almost an year. Reason for lay off was cost cutting.
"Nothing specific in terms of cons , employee engagement can be improvised"
"people first organisation , Very good in terms of employee benefits"
"Extremely employee friendly, hardly feels like an corporate office. Will get to learn TDD, agile practices and technical breadth on vast amount of technologies. Gives good food and snack options. Remote/Hybrid working setup."
Lot of learnings so good place to start your career
"Not much compensation, and kind politics is also there"
Opportunity to gain knowledge and to work on.
None. Best work life balance.
1. Loved the culture followed within the organisation. 2. Employees are quite knowledgable and always willing to help others. 3. Management is supportive. 4. Collaboration within the team members are always visible. 5. etc.
Not figured out any specific cons as of now.
Salary come on time and that is it
"No guidance from the management, bunch of confused people, they do practice what they preach their so called culture is a myth."
Great culture and Work life balance
I don't find any concerns as of now.
Flexibility to switch projects
Office politics is emerging
Good for freshers Good culture
none as of now for me
Good projects and latest technology
Good environment to work and grow
Flexibility Good Employee facilities Nice Pay
Zero work life balance (Depends on size of your team) - No transparency to management - Zero accountability and ownership - Lack of communication channel to the higher management - In short nobody cares about you.
loads of learning - unlimited sick leaves - self managing work culture
salary could be better
"Great culture, people are always there to help -Wide opportunities within org to learn more new technologies"
Nothing in so far experienced
Great work culture 2. They value their employee 3. Work-life balance is valued 4. Best place for freshers to grow up
Nothing as of now
Amazing company to work for nowdays
None that I can think off
Good learning from fellow employees - Better Compensations & Benefits - Best work life balance
"Every six months you have to go through a learning cycle, and you are forced two do something extra than your work"
Has wide opportunity to grow Can take up different initiatives along with project Flat Hirarchy
Nothing I can think as of now
No hierarchical structure fosters healthy work culture and apolitical environment
No such cons identified so far
"Tech company, Research group - e4r, Great opportunity as a sci-tech writer and communicator."
Travel to office is troublesome and tiring considering the heavy traffic and not-so-good road conditions.
Standards followed are of best quality without compromise. Ample opportunities to learn and grow. No politics (I didn't face any)
Introverts might feel intimidated by vocal culture and practices like pair programming. But people are nice and supportive in general.
ThoughtWorks is all about collaboration and inclusiveness. - People get valued as individual human beings - Work-life balance is awesome - There are a lot of learning opportunities and at each and every step Thoughtworks & Thoughtworkers help - Good salary hike
If you are shy or don't believe in collaboration may not be Thoughtworks is not for you.
Work culture Growth Pay Feedback system Projects
Recognition. I think I don't find any cons
- Extremely good for beginners - Flexibility to try various roles - Open to suggest ideas - Lot of projects with good tech landscape - Learn a lot from peers
More freedom means more responsibility. Need to plan for your career growth. - After IPO lot of changes (Not all of them are employee friendly) - No clear growth path after certain level.(Need to be self designed)
Great culture and people Great company to explore and learn
Nothing in my experience so far.
"Work life balance, work culture, personal growth opportunities"
Negligible or no hike at all
Good work culture. Friendly workers.
"As of now, nothing to say."
1. Work culture 2. Intellectual people 3. Diversity
"There are few things which I believe is common across all IT companies, but this small things can be ignored because of more advantages."
* Great Culture! * Amazing people to work with
"* Low pay, perks and benefits"
Most talented people in tech - Benefits to live for !
Work can get tedious for some clients
"Good projects Good people (Good peers, but there are No good leaders) Good benefits WFH, H&W, L&D, Gadgets, Internet and mobile expense reiumbersment Insurance package is provided"
"Thoughtworks culture is spoiling day by day with bad people being put on higher roles. - There is no 360 feedback, feedback is only b/w peers(1-1) thats it, ideally feedback should be collected by HR team, from everyone on the team."
good for trying all different coding options at cost of client
"many, including all favoritisms , all sr long tenured people throwing tantrums and running the org with their old 'oh we did it this way' mentality, practically no long term onsite opportunity(unless u like to lick shoes of these sr folks)"
"Quality of peers and colleagues - Trust and encouragement to employees - extremely employee centric - respectful, inclusive/accepting, supportive and understanding - strong culture rooted in a strong set of values - thought leader in the industry - lots of opportunities to learn and grow - a strong community - freedom to express and respectfully disagree"
can be overwhelming in the beginning to adjust - the skills and talent and culture is so strong - you might need time to adjust and feel like a Thoughtworker (but there are always people and team members who help you with that)
Opportunity to work with talented people * Great and very acceptable office culture * Opportunity to work on various set of projects + tech stacks * Work life balance
Individual experience depends a lot on direct tech lead / manager.
. Talented folks with good attitude 2. Good Pay 3. Flexible to WFH based on project 4. Many learning opportunities 5. True flat hierarchy
1. Not easy to switch projects 2. No travel opportunities
"No compliant, everything is good"
low salary as per currentmarket
"No Discrimination encourage employees to maintain Work life balance, take offs, contribute to community on all values They consider social contribution too They encourage gender parity, equality which is very important"
They need to consider the salaries offered wrt market.
You will learn lot of new stuff
nothing as such. Keep up the good work
Worl life balance and techstack
Nothing can think of as of now
"Great bunch of knowledgeable people to learn from, enthusiastic, thorough professionals."
"Business development fellows are little slow vs rest of world, should accelerate their progress for organization's development and greater good."
Good tech stack. Get to work on multiple tech simultaneously. Good leaves policy Good compensation Good WLB
Pair Programming can be hectic at times
"Nice culture, helpful people, employee centric"
None that i can think of apart from the fact that I was laid off
Great opportunities to learn. Tech stacks are good
Salary are not up to the market standards
Best learning and mentor programs Opportunity to learn helps you get the best in your craft
cant think of anything right now
good work culture good management nice opportunity to grow good communities to explore and be part of it
I did not found any major cons
flat hierarchy is a good
Too much voice which leads to delay in decision making
