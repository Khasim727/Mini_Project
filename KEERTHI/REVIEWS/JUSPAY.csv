no learning curve heavy on call
work from home.good team and people
Lot of work load .
Learning is good in this company.
Sometimes work might become hectic. I have seen we are recruiting lot of people these days and quality of people getting hired is somewhat down now.
I worked on a whole project from end to end. You can learn lots of things and as a fresher writing a production ready code and taking care of project from start to end is a very big thing. Flexible work hours. Free food at all three times. Macbook are some other pros.
"Test it tough, interview is difficult, selection is difficult"
"Good salary, big office, great people, great work, good environment"
Lunch is not good and Nothing
"Environment is good,and Haskell functional Language"
nothing at all in my view
you will be getting best mentors
NO work pressure and good work culture
"Nothing as for now , its all great"
Juspay does good engineering and have plenty of smart employees. The senior management is open to suggestions and you can work with them to solve interesting problems.
Not everyone is comfortable with hard requirement of Haskell and Purescript.
