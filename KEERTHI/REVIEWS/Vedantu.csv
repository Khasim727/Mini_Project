"The edtech story in India is over. They will fire you even after you achieve your target. Even if your HR says, you will have a work-life balance you will not Your managers are gonna kill you. Get used to working till 9:00 or 10:00 Lastly, what are you gonna do even if you are the favourite guy and you are promoted as a manager or a senior manager? Life is not short but this Edtech jobs are"

good culture firm for employees
workload is high in comparison
1. Work-Life Balance 2. 5 Days Working
"1. Weak leadership, hence office politics 2. Lack of accountability (COO has not been asked to go despite revenue falling straight from last 6 months)"
We can improve our counselling skills. On time salary.
Target oriented..no fixed timings. So many meetings. No job security.
Decent salary Working atmosphere relatively better
work pressure sometimes no holidays on weekend
"Healthy work environment, growth, growing edtech"
Company is on cost cutting mode. Hence layoffs going on
good for everyone nice place to work

Less workload sometimes and then all the deliverables are needed at once
- No new projects - Majority of interns(now full time) in tech come from same college so no diversity - Legacy code base
