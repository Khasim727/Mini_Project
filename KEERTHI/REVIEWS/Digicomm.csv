Good work Environment Good Management Balance Work Amazing Seniors Nice pay and hike
"NO Cons, All good for Fresher"
I can not think of any pros
They are money minded and no good projects
Not a single pros about the company
Everything is a con. Please have a look at the Salary structure before joining or before giving certificates
I worked for 2 and half years here. As a fresher starting career here is right choose. You can get good and decent hikes here.
Need some more clients and good projects.
There are no pros honestly. Business minded people all around in management.
Only one moto for management that is to make money .
I completed 2 yrs with digicomm. I have joined as a fresher and I learn lots of technical stuff under guidance of experience person Good learning experience
Not enough cultural activities From personal point of view: Less number of leaves yearly
Helpful Management team and Employee Friendly ... Take every feedback seriously
Nothing as such till now
Good place to work and encouraging management towards developing our professional skills
Nothing to say .... just provide more benefits to employees.
Always got support and help from my team members. Faculties are very friendly and have learned a lot from them.
Nothing specific to point out.
In Vaswani Presidio Building Other than Nothing I have seen ...
Hiring by giving fake job offer like 1) vacancy in ODC 2)1 lakh increment in every 6 month
"it is a growing company, friendly environment and good for fresher good support from seniors."
as of now i dont have any issues
Nothing I have seen in my experience
1.Conducting training batches by giving fake promises and collecting 75k without proper receipt and terminating without giving single opportunity. 2. Doesn't have proper licensed tools
Have a scope to push your abilities.
"poor management and lot, but i am seeing they are working hard to provide good things to employees ."
Work life balance Liberty to explore any new technology and learn new stuff Knowledgeable co workers
No cons to mention in particular
One best service company to start career with 1. good learning environment 2. talented folks around to guide
Little pressure may build up at times but it too adds as a learning
I have started working as a fresher . During my tenure in Digicomm i learned a lot . Senior management is very supportive .
More training sessions should be conducted
Fast growing company Good learning exposure industry standard pay scale
facing problems in lunch time for food no good canteen near the company
Good work culture positive work environment Lots of new opportunities Projects are very good Nice work life balance Flexible work timings Workplace is new and well maintained.
No cons as such.Never thought of cons
