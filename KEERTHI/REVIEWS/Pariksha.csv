Supportive and Energetic Top Management - Amazing Work environment - Work life Balance - Autonomy for driving change - Young team
Would be better if stability was good
You can learn here everything
No Cons at the moment
I don't think so any
"1. Good exposure. 2. You are responsible for your own product/feature. 3. Get to do a lot of things, if asked for."
Strong product/tech team Mangement allows learning oppotunities Recent technologies
Benefits are ok okay. Still improving. Although nothing bad. It is workable.
Healthy environment of work place.
Management sometimes takes time to solve grievances Other than that all good
Not a good option for future
* you will get your salary on time * will be allowed to work on your statergy * our suggestion will be considered
"Good working environment, A lot new technologies to learn"
* can me more activities inside the employees of the company to interact and refreshment
Nice and great. startup and fastest growing ed-tech company
Nothing as such except sometimes work load is more
"Organizational model, six day working week"
"- Small team so lots of room to develop and take ownership of work. - The engineering challenges faced during development are interesting and unique, which makes for a great place to learn. - Great co-workers."
Chance to shape the future of EdTech
Work can get a bit hectic sometimes.
None so far that I can think of
Best tech minds to work with. Nice challenging work. One gets to work on latest tech in the industry
There are no cons as of now.
Best place and good team
Fully pressured and target based
none. i didn't find any pros.
It's a relatively new start-up.
"no manner, no respect, no payment on time, Always less payment than expected. Staff is not professional"
Best online classes for maths.
Work Culture is very good
Nothing as such I found
