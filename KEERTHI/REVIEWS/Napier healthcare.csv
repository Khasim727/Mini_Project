Team is so supportive and manager
Salary not on time delayed
Product company into health care
"No vision, just developing product with no customers"
Highly skilled engineering managers Scope to become multiskilled technologist Got a chance to implement our own ideas as a part of product culture More focused on clean code practices with in the product development
Have to increase the employee benefits Need to redefine the existing product documentation for new joiners for KT purpose
Great work life balance Good learning experience
The company is having fund issues A bit of unorganized
Good company for experienced people
They do not follow the proper agile process
Few may get chance to work on trending technologies.
No Teamwork. Poor management. No proper planning. No work life balance. Micro management.

Nothing to say hear seriously
1. Decent insurance coverage policies for self. 2. On-time credit of salary by every month end. 3. Good maintenance of EPF(Proper monthly credit).
1. Very poor management of projects(Multiple failed projects). 2. No proper processes in place for project management.
"Little micro-management ( don't know at the movement ), nothing else as I know"
"good company, timely salary, good projects, healthcare domain"
Best learning scope platform and interesting project also
No issues I found till now
"Leads & Heads, Work Culture, Best HR policies, Friendly HR, Open for new ideas, Growth Opportunities, Best Compensation, Timely payout"
Work from Home. Company should call all the employees to work from office like all other companies atleast to operate on hybrid model
Ok company for Freshers and Healthcare SMEs
It can do better then what it is currently
Great Work Culture and Managers are very supportive.
Didn’t found any cons till now
"good learning. supportive and friendly team , managers are open to discussions"
componsation and benifits should be according to market standards
Didn't see any positive points to mention.
Seems company facing critical financial crisis. Last three months salaries not credited till mid of the next month. Be think before choose this company. HR - no words to say.
Good atmosphere to learn new things.
Work life balance was not good
No Pros as I think of.
This company runs mainly for Tax saving purpose for chairman. There are no clients and accept clients some time just to pay them fines and there is un expected firing every time.
Best management and friendly environment
No condition found in organization
Good work environment. Interview process is not too complicated
These people don't care about their employees. No response to the interviewees. Worst management
Very good environment is provided by the company.
Too many ideas floating around and prescious gets done
Good place to learn work
Not that much good but ok to work
Scope for improvement is huge
financial growth is less when compared with others in market
"Good for freshers to learn, (but only for an year)"
"Low salaries, almost no hikes, micromanagement, etc."
"growth and learning scope ,good environment."
Overall Woking is good with nice environment and work life balance
Open to Learn new technology and also implement the new methods
Product Based Organization. Competitive Salary but with no hikes.
"Micro Management, Lack of Trust by the Leadership"
"Great Place for freshers to learn and grow. I joined in Pandemic time, the onboarding Process was very smooth. The team was so supportive and comfortable. They Welcomed me with a beautiful welcoming kit."
Till now I didn't found any cons on this company.
"whenever need help I can raise a ticket through the website, and that must be resolved by EOD."
"Very Professional process, nothing is there as cons."
"Too much work, so great learning experience for beginners."
Development and bug fixing in one sprint is too much stress
You'll maybe get to go out on a team lunch once in a year.
Good learning curve for freshers
The interview process was done very quickly. The onboarding process went smoothly. They welcomed us by giving beautiful welcome kit. Friendly talk.
Nothing as of now. Happy with the scope of work & progress.
Legacy product with good customer base
"Except CEO, all leadership positions have a span of 6 months to 1 year. CEO is a good English teacher than strategic leader. Very insecure CEO"
Did not come across as of now
Nothing as such to mention
Only who are close associate of managers will grow

Good work culture and Transparency.
Everything is nice. Good support from leaders.
Excellent employees. Cash rich investors. Positive looking industry. Product mindset. Napier has got good reputation in market.
Excessive micro-management. Weak Indian Management due to the exit of key leaders in last couple of years.
Good company and hrs interactions also good
lot of learning for fresher
Micro monitoring management and don't not clear idea of about product scope.
Slow growth and less clientele to work with
Good learning platform for the employees
Good Company for Software Developers.
There are no cons in the company.
Excellent management and learning environment
