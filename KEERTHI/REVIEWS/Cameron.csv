The managers of respective departments called employees in their personal mobile phones and told them to resign voluntarily (to save their job from lay off) and not mention COVID as reason for leaving the company.

Not a good management in Coimbatore.
Free lunch. You eat it daily and you get ulcer in no time.
Incompetent management. 
"Pretty good company; they provide good employee benefits They are one of the top giants in oil industry , wonderful place to work"
After acquisition of schlumberger and due to current downfall in oil industry there is always fear among employees about job security.
It's good to people can join now in Schlumberger coimbatore work life balance was good.
Above said everything was good to new joiners not for who's working already there.
The knowledge is shrunk to some extent
The brand that Cameron possess is always a positive effect on employees.
Cameron in India needs a much more comprehensive transparent set of general policies on employees.
"Good place to learn more profile wise help you to build your career, good pay master, there are lots of management oriented trainings, very good work environment"
there are no cons as such. the perks and benefits depends on the oil price overall
Decent salary in coimbatore Complementary lunch
Stupid team leaders Politics No flexi timing only new comers will be paid high Promotion very difficult no transparency in promotion and pay
If you are experienced and looking for a stress free job to settle then go for it.
"No motivation, recognition or value to the hard working employees"
The questions asked for the interview was pretty good and not so hard
You will have to sign a bond for 4 years
I am good in using design softwares and will easily adapt to the situation and move with it.
Will take some time to understand and executing the concepts.
"Work life balance, Free lunch and team events"
Increments are unstable and no carrier growth
"No pressure, good work and life balance."
Career wise you won't see any growth. You will get bored and afraid of your future.
all well balanced career progression
Nothings to tell cons for this
It's an good company for the each individual one
Exposure is good and a great place to learn things.
Sometimes lack ability to attract the open minded and intelligent talents.
