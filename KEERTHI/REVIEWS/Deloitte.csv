1) Work-Life Balance is disastrous. You will need to work more than 15 Hrs sometimes and work 80hrs a week.
The work culture has been adversely impacted specially after Covid and work from home. Global attrition has increased the demand for the resources in USI leading to excessive work being given to everyone and no respect anymore for work life.
