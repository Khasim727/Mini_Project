"Flexible, Open Culture, Good Team, Wide Opportunities"
None to be mentioned in specific
Qualified/smart direct colleagues - Fair work-life-balance - Products sell
Ineffective middle management - New Executives coming in to break and change the culture to be a more "Fortune 500-like" company without the tools and processes to support it 
"Good Products, Great CEO. Freshdesk and Freshservice are some of the products which can match any top enterprise products which is priced at almost half the price."
Life is a circle. Freshworks has been no different.
Whatever good the company had is now lost. Complete decay.
Let's start at the top: Solutions Engineering team has the worst leadership. Illiterate imbeciles have been given the management roles in this department.
- Knowledge of some engineers. - Strong sales and marketing.
"- No simplicity in a very simple SaaS product. - Organisation is product driven. Impractical or suboptimal ideas, timelines, hasty releases, unsatisfied customers, no sync with engineering from product."
"Good Product, Great market reach, very comprehensive customer success strategy, great acceptance in mid-market and unicorn startup community"
Salary on time Good office environment Lunch ESPP
1. JOB SECURITY has become a joke now. 2. Giving your 100% for work doesn't matter here.
couldn't think of anything which is really a Pros in this organization. Sry leaders but yeah no more pros.
So things were going well and things changed overnight because of a wrong hire in Presale/SE team.
Nothing to say about this

Good benefits offered and security for now
None for now Can’t think of anything
free food and ESOP option
"No job security at al, manager can find any reason to fire you. Employee review system is worst, they simply ask employee to resign in 2 days, just like that. Check google news for recent layoffs."
"Great food, kind people, growth mindset"

Decent pay. Standard benefits across industries
1. Micromanagement 2. Toxic environment 3. Firing culture has began to creep in
Good products that can compete globally not only from pricing perspective but also from quality and ease of use perspective.
"Used to be a great place to work. Unfortunately, it is not anymore. Not just employee experience, but a whole lot of other factors make it a deadly combo."
I worked in Freshworks for more than 1 year and 6 months. You will get the recognision if you do your work properly. Salary part is best and the food they provide as well
No conss as per my experience
(giving 5 star only for myreview comes up or else u would have given -1)
The company is only based on politics and if you are out of Chennai then they will make sure you perform your worst by demotivating you
Nothing to say about this
Change in Culture under a year
"Salary, Food + Transport, Snacks, 24 hrs tea and coffee"
"Layoffs,"
Nothing anymore that can be called out
Freshworks has lost its core value.
* Culture * Free food * Rewards and recognition
"Became very metrics oriented compared to when I join. I'm not against the idea of being metrics oriented, but the metrics should come organically and not at the cost of quality."
1. Every employee is valued. 2. Happy culture!
1. Nothing I can think of.
1. Every employee is valued. 2. Happy culture!
very open culture. You approach anyone
too many changes at once. So many leadership hirings and leaders bring their own work style
Company is full of pros only
"No cons at all, seriously"
Brand Value that this company gives to your resume so that you can use it in your next employment.
Poor culture Unnecessary spends Too many leaders even for smaller teams Lot of chaos in the process Favoritism
"Food, travel, snacks and RSUs"
My experience with Freshworks is terrible.

Office cabs Good food Learning of SAAS business
Culture died Poor compensation Change in leave policy Hiring freeze and promotions delay Layoffs
Young and energetic colleagues. HR policy is good. Products in general specifically Freshdesk and Freshdesk are world class. High performance is rewarded well.
Much better options available outside
No career growth Hike low
Everything looks bright and shiny from outside; you get to know the reality once you are inside. 
I know there are several 100’s of people like me who went through this and some are still going through this. Some of these people are silently moving out every day.
Had a ton of them when I joined but now it’s reduced to nothing
Change in leadership has adversely impacted the culture of Freshworks. It’s no longer the company it used to be talked about.
Organization wise good company Lot of benefits
Micro management Low career growth
50+ EMPLOYEES CHEATED IN THE GARB OF IPO. WORST EMPLOYEE DELIGHT for new Kudumba members.
I sincerely wish managers and leadership had not done this at first place. Or at the least course corrected when employees shared discontent.
-Great work culture -Super supportive management
-Less to learn in the org
Everything is a pro here
No cons in this company
"Free food, Cabs, Rest Pros are in the bin after IPO"
1. toxic work-culture 2. hypocritical and cold hearted management with man-child managers treating employees like slaves
Please help me out of the situations
this site was great.it is very helpful.

Awesome Teammates. Awesome Learning. Great product. Good Food. Agile.
"Recently too stingy. (internet benefits removed, Accessory benefits removed, Fitness benefits removed) Bad/No hike, Hike politics exists here too No appreciation of done work."
Good culture. Great learning. Beautiful workplace
Hikes are poor post IPO
Excellent company and culture in the company
I had a bad manager who indirectly forced me to leave
"Work-life balance, food and transport facility"
"My experience hasn't been that great at Freshworks. I think they should improve on their training part for the employees,"
Focus on quality of work
"A lot of processes, specially post IPO"
Very Good place to work
Some teams are polluted here
Company culture is too good Employee benefits
