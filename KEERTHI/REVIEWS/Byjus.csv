Gave me lots of opportunity to grow
Did not have any bonus
The company is really good for a person who wants to build a career in sales and who has a zeal and enthusiasm to perform and meet the targets. The company pays you well for the hardwork you put in.
It is difficult to maintain work life balance with weekends working. Only Mondays off is hectic at times.
It is the best company as far as growth opportunities and salary structure. I was a little uncertain about joining the company with weekend working but now I am glad that I made this choice and made it to learn a lot.
"Personal life is lost, Minor issues with the company."
Package and colleagues and also the concept of conceptual way of learning is great but work culture and the way of handling customers --- worst!
"The main pro is we will learn people management, escalation management and stress management"
"There are a lot, like no work culture, no respect for employees at any level, worst company for any employee. No time for personal life. The targets are set in such a way that we have to sacrifice our personal life to achieve targets."
The pay was good until Karan Bajaj was the CEO
Oh boy everything is a con here. They slashed down the pay more than half for every employee. They started putting new rules that were like a noose around the teachers. They started with reducing the leaves we can take and then they forced us to even work on weekends by constantly calling us and asking us to open slots on weekends. They kept asking us to sign various contracts and it still hasn’t stopped!
"The only thing is salary and incentive, and growth. Nothing can expect more than that."
"The pressure you have is weekly targets, and they will be achieved sometimes and maybe not. So, it's based on the manager and how they treat you."
Good salary package If you have backlogs still you can work here I’ve to keep thinking about pros as it doesn’t exist in this company
"Well you don’t have to think about cons because this company only serves you negativity and toxic work environment where you’ve to work 6 days in a week for 12hrs daily, no personal life and even if you get one day leave on Monday then also they will give you some assignment to complete."
The office was spacious and good.
"product , content is literally amazing"
work culture is extremally toxic
no pros as such. Bread and butter maybe
"stupid management, no hike/negligible hike, not a corporate.. it is like a govt job with stress"
Freedom of doing things yourself
Excess sales pressure and you are responsible for people who don't report to u.
this is a very good experi
good experience i like it

nothing much just a bit of pressure
Job security is very less

"Very good job envirnment, hectic job profile. If have good skill or better skill, you will nail it."
sales target is must and some it is very tough
As company provides time for work life balance
If they conduct some personal meetings with HR individually means then the expectations of the employee can reach
Work culture in media team is good
Have to be ready to face office politics
Work form home is the best for this type of job
If they ask to come office to do just copy paste.
"If your are new to creative field then this is best place to work. Friendly environment, No pressure on work and you will get lot of senior artist to learn and explore."
Nothing to say on this.
"Get to learn new things, you will always find something difficult but once you are aware about it then there is nothing more easier, good package and increment"
"Did not find any, however people take the byjus's name in negative manner. It is simple that if you are getting a good pay then you should be flexible as well with the assignments"
You get to work with smart individuals who are constantly on their feet to deliver high-quality content. You build great working relationships with people and get to learn a lot.
"The management sucks! Lay-offs are happening everywhere, but the way Byju's has laid-off is very inhuman."

work life balance is not there
Good Incentives at the early ages & WFH Was far more better than the WFO. WFO has Too much Stress on High performing employees than the others.
12hrs of work everyday. There is not work life balance. Lot of pressure which has impacted my communication skillset because most of the employees speak regional language.
"Company based on direct sales, help in understanding grassroot level management"
Too much work pressure to handle
If you are a workaholic then you'll earn atleast 5k more every month by achieving targets.
Work timings should be a bit less inorder to get more efficient productivity.
