Reviews
Synopsys is a very good company in terms of work life balance and team work.
I donot have any negative point in this section.
"Learning opportunities are there, depends on management and your manager the quality of work you'll be getting ..Sometimes work can be repetitive."
Salary and compensation is not at par with the industry standards .Benefits could have been so much better
Salary is good but learning is poor
"Layoffs , Team politics , Learning curve is poor, Team engagement is poor."
"Except salary, everything is good. Supportive colleagues to great work life balance"
Salary is paid less as compared to market
Synopsys work culture and employee’s.
"If you’re an intern hired from off campus , hardly they’ll give you full time offer."

"Co. policies and job security are the highest rated things. However, career grown is limited and old school thought process."
Work life balance is no more a part of culture with WFH coming in. Soft skill training for employees and managers training is missing overall.
I like my team very much
It is one of the best companies having benefit policies and always encouraging the employee. Best work culture. No micromanagement.
Nothing as such. I love the management of the company.
Highly ethical and extremely professional management. They make sure that the employees are given the best for giving their best.??
